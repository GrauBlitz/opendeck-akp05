# OpenDeck Ajazz AKP05 / Mirabox N4 Plugin

An unofficial plugin for Mirabox N4-family devices

## OpenDeck version

Requires OpenDeck 2.5.0 or newer

## Supported devices

- MiraBox N4 (6603:1007)

## Known limitations and issues

- Touchscreen and encoder buttons are currently not handled (they only send a single state, not pressed/released)
- Touchscreen swiping actions are not working (maybe need to use some imaginery extra buttons?)
- OpenDeck shows one button to many which has currently no function

## Platform support

- Linux: Guaranteed, if stuff breaks - I'll probably catch it before public release
- Mac: Best effort, no tests before release, things may break, but I probably have means to fix them
- Windows: Zero effort, no tests before release, if stuff breaks - too bad, it's up to you to contribute fixes

## Installation

1. Download an archive from [releases](https://github.com/4ndv/opendeck-akp03/releases)
2. In OpenDeck: Plugins -> Install from file
3. Download [udev rules](./40-opendeck-akp03.rules) and install them by copying into `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and running `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`
4. Unplug and plug again the device, restart OpenDeck

## Adding new devices
